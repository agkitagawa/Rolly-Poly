Based on the game Geometry Dash. Press space to jump and avoid obstacles. 
Speed up and slow down by hitting power-up blocks. Makes use of a physics 
engine, sound effects, changing backgrounds, and text. Worked with 
Thanhthanh Nguyen, Felipe Cruz Falquez, Edward Zhang (Introduction to 
Software Design at California Institute of Technology). 

Physics engine files have been ommitted at the request of the professor, 
as their implementation is part of the course, and sharing them publicly 
could give future students an unfair advantage.
